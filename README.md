# Description

In this day and age it is critically important to have an online presence, especially if
you're a retailer. Almost everyone does a significant amount of shopping online so to 
be competitive in this climate a retailer not only needs an online store front, 
but a solid database to go with it. This back-end setup will keep all the products 
organized so that customers can easily find what they are looking for.
